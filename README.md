### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thomas Bivins and I am a Software Systems Engineer at the [Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD)](https://www.navair.navy.mil/nawctsd/) where I work in the design / acquisitions of various training systems for the US Navy. My work centers acquisitions, as well as Model-Based Systems Engineering using integrated MATLAB/SysML/Python Models. I also have a great passion for web development and find that I learn something new every day.
